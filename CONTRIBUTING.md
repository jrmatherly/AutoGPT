## Contributing to the AutoGPT Platform Folder

All contributions to [the autogpt_platform folder](https://github.com/jrmatherly/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform) will be under our [Contribution License Agreement](https://github.com/jrmatherly/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20(CLA).md). By making a pull request contributing to this folder, you agree to the terms of our CLA for your contribution. All contributions to other folders will be under the MIT license.

## In short

1. Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2. We encourage you to collaborate with fellow community members on some of our bigger
   [todo's][roadmap]!
   - We highly recommend to post your idea and discuss it in the [dev channel].
3. Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes.
4. Adhere to the [Code Guidelines]
5. Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
6. Don't submit broken code: test/validate your changes.
7. Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal
   preferences. Doing so is the maintainers' job. ;-)
8. Please also consider contributing something other than code; see the
   [contribution guide] for options.
